# 🧠 GCP MarTech Analytics Warehouse

**Data Engineering & Marketing Analytics Automation Pipeline**

This repository contains the codebase for the **Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Marketing Technology Analytics Warehouse**. It is designed to automate the extraction, transformation, and loading **(ETL/ELT)** of multi-channel marketing data into **BigQuery** for advanced analytics, reporting, and budget optimization.

---

## 📦 Overview

The GCP MarTech Analytics Warehouse integrates diverse marketing data sources (including **Google Ads**, **Google Analytics 4**, **Meta Ads**, **LinkedIn Ads**, **TikTok Ads**) into a **centralized BigQuery warehouse**.

### Core Pipeline Mechanics: The Medallion Architecture

I follow a strict Bronze -> Silver -> Gold data flow to ensure data quality, lineage, and performance.

🟤 1. Bronze Layer (Raw Ingestion)

**Goal:** Ingest data from APIs with 100% fidelity. **Tech Stack:** Python (Custom Airflow Operators) -> BigQuery.

**1. Extraction:**
Raw data is extracted using custom Python scripts via official **APIs** for each platform. The data is ingested directly into a **Bronze (Raw)** dataset in BigQuery.

- **Idempotency:** I enforce strict idempotency using DELETE (based on Date/Account) before INSERT. This allows any DAG to be re-run safely without creating duplicate records.

**2. Loading Strategy:**
The Google Ads pipeline comprises **21 distinct extraction modules** producing 21 raw tables, Meta Ads pipeline comprises **12 distinct extraction modules** producing 12 raw tables and Other (CRM related) extraction comprises **2 distinct extraction modules**. The load process implements advanced data engineering logic:

- **Historical Backfill:** Captures the past 3 years of data to enable Year-over-Year (YoY) and Year-to-Date (YTD) performance comparison.


- **Incremental Loading:** Efficiently appends new daily records to the historical dataset.


- **Rolling Lookback Window (CDC):** Implements a 14-day lookback window to capture **Change Data (CDC)** and **Attribution Lag** (e.g., conversions attributed days after the ad click).


- **Partitioning:** Handled within the Python load step; tables are partitioned by `DATE` for query optimization.


- **Clustering:** Tables utilize clustered columns (e.g., `Campaign ID`, `Ad Group ID`, `Important Columns`) to reduce query costs and latency.

---

**🥈 2. Silver Layer (Staging & Normalization)**

**Goal:** Clean, standardize, and prepare data for joining. **Tech Stack:** dbt Core (View Materialization).

**Materialization Strategy:** Configured as view.

- Why? Views act as a "pass-through" window. They provide **Instant Change Data Capture (CDC)**—as soon as raw data lands in Bronze, the Silver view reflects it immediately.


- Cost Benefit: Since Views store no physical data, this layer incurs $0 Storage Cost.

**Transformation Logics:**

- **Schema Standardization:** Enforces strict data typing across all tables (e.g., SAFE_CAST to INT64/FLOAT64) and normalizes column names to snake_case, ensuring consistent schema definitions regardless of the source platform.


- **Smart Parsing & Normalization:** Cleans inconsistent dimensional data using CASE logic to handle legacy naming conventions, ensuring historical data aligns with current reporting structures.


- **Global Product Mapping:** Automatically joins ad data with the `Global Products Calendar` to map generic campaigns to specific product instances (e.g., mapping "LEAP Riyadh" to "LEAP Riyadh 2025", mapping "AVIATION WEEK" to "AVIATION WEEK 2025", mapping "WHX Dubai" to "WHX Dubai 2027").


- **Dynamic Pricing tiers:** Calculates "Cut-Off Rates" (e.g., *SEB*, *EB*, *Advance*, *FP*, *Standard*, *Onsite*) based on the transaction date relative to the product calendar.


- **Countdown Logic:** Computes `Weeks Out` metrics (e.g., "Week 10", "Week 0") to enable time-relative performance curves for comparing products performance year-over-year.


- **Local Currency Preservation:** Maintains original currency and cost metrics as reported by the source API (GBP, EUR, USD, etc.) to ensure 100% financial alignment with the platform UI.

**Cost Saving (Slim CI):** In the Development Environment, I use Jinja Macros ({% if target.name == 'dev' %}) to limit processing to the last 14 days. This reduces cloud compute costs by >90% during testing.


- Full Historical Integrity (Prod): While Dev is optimized for speed, the Production pipeline automatically bypasses these filters to process the full historical dataset, ensuring accurate Year-over-Year (YoY) and Year-to-Date (YTD) trend analysis.

---

**🥇 3. Gold Layer (Marts & Business Intelligence)**

**Goal:** Aggregated, business-ready tables for Dashboarding. **Tech Stack:** dbt Core (Table Materialization).

**Materialization Strategy:** Configured as table.

- Why? Tables persist data physically. This is crucial for BI tools (Power BI) because complex UNION ALL operations and Joins are computed once during the morning run, protecting the dashboard from slow query times.

**Logic:**

- **Consolidation:** Stacks Google and Meta data into a single ads_performance master table.

- **Optimization:** Tables are Partitioned (by Date) and Clustered (by Platform/Product/Important Columns) to ensure high-speed filtering.

---

### Orchestration Architecture

The pipeline is orchestrated using **Apache Airflow** deployed via two distinct **Docker containers**:

**Coupling Strategy: Tightly Coupled DAGs**

I deliberately group the Transformation phase (Silver -> Gold) into a single atomic DAG.

- **Why Tightly Coupled?** To guarantee data integrity.


- **The Risk of Decoupling:** If I separated Silver and Gold into different DAGs, a failure in Silver could lead to Gold running on stale data.

**The Solution:** By coupling them, we ensure an Atomic Transaction: either the entire pipeline succeeds, or it stops at the error, preventing "silent failures" in the dashboard.

**Deployment Model**

- **Airflow-Dev:** Contains 34 DAGs using **PostgreSQL**. No scheduling enabled. Used strictly for development testing, unit validation, and "Slim CI" runs.

- **Airflow-Prod:** Contains 34 DAGs using **PostgreSQL**. Daily scheduling is active. Used for deploying and orchestrating core ETL processes on full data history.

**📚 Data Dictionary (SharePoint)**

The single source of truth for all metric definitions, schema lineage, and column descriptions is maintained in the MarTech Data Dictionary on SharePoint. This file serves as the blueprint for our BigQuery schema.

- **File Name:** MarTech Dictionary.xlsx


- **Content:** Detailed data points for Google Ads, Meta Ads, LinkedIn Ads, and TikTok Ads (separated by sheets).

**Key References:**

- Marketing Bronze Sheet, 
- Marketing Silver Sheet, 
- Marketing Gold Sheet.

This specific sheet defines the exact schema for the **Bronze (Raw)** layer in BigQuery. It is used to validate Python extraction scripts and dbt source definitions (`src_marketing.yml`).

**Schema Definition Columns:**

**Marketing Bronze Sheet:**

- `table_no`: Unique identifier for the table in the pipeline.

- `table_name`: Technical name of the table.

- `column_no`: The ordinal position of the column in the final view.

- `column_name`: The standardized, snake_case column name as it appears in the Silver view.

**Marketing Gold Sheet:**

- `layer`: The pipeline stage identifier (e.g., `gold`).

- `logic`: The business logic applied to the table (e.g., `business_ready`).

- `materialization`: The storage strategy used in BigQuery (e.g., `table`).

- `script_name`: The technical name of the dbt model (e.g., `ads_campaign_performance`, `ads_conversion_action`).

- `dataset_name`: The target BigQuery dataset where the table is created (e.g., `marketing_prod_gold`).
